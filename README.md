# GenerativeManifoldModelNetwork
In the paper, we introduce the visualization method to support forming the team.
It's the network consisting of *generative manifold modelings*.
Proposed method can visualize the relationship among own team composition, opposing one, own team's performance.
This repository contains the implementation of proposed method.
When you run the python script, the interactive visualization will run.

## Getting started
Please build the Python environment satisfies the requirements in the `pyproject.toml`.
If you use poetry, run `poetry install`.
In addition, please make `tkinter` available in the Python environment because the visualization implemented by matplotlib works only when backend is set to `TkAgg`.
